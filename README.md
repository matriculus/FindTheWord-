# FindTheWord!: Privacy policy
Welcome to FindTheWord! app for Android!

This is a closed source Android app developed by Vishnu Lex.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. The App neither connects online nor collects any location, name or any other information. Even search terms are also not recorded anywhere in the app. It is a completely offline app with no requirement of user data.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Vishnu Lex.
